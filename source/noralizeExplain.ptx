<p>In your knn_single_prediction function for task 1, you are asked to use the np.linalg.norm(). I have received quite a few questions about what this is doing, and how to properly use it in the program, so I will go over that here.</p>
<p>As the instructions state, you are trying to calculate the ‘distance’ away your new_example input is from all of the test data.</p>
<p>You may recall from a prior math or physics class where you calcualted distance between two points using a “distance formula” that likely looked something like :
<m>d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}</m></p>
<p>if (x1,y1) is (0,0), you may be able to recognize this as solving for the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
<p>In calc2 and later physics classes, you will use a similar function to determine the magnitude of vectors.</p>
<p>In Calc3, you will learn you can use this same thing for finding the distance between two points in 3 dimensions too (and as many as you may want):
<m>(d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2+ (z_2 - z_1)^2}</m></p>
<p>Per the original function name, this process is called normalization.  ‘normalizing’ values calculated the magnitude of the values provided.  You can provide 2 values, 3 values, even dozens of values if you wanted to, and the function will add up the square of all of the values, and then take the square root to provide a normalized value.</p>
<p>Numpy arrays make this go very quickly, as they have a normalization function already.  You can replicate this using standard numpy operations too.</p>
